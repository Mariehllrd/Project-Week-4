## Project Description
Last september, a Global Summit was hosted by the European Council and the main subject was the growing mistrust of vaccination, fear of side effects, and, “herd immunity.” 
In this analysis, I will try and get a more global picture on how are people supporting vaccination and see if vaccines skepticism affect immunization coverage.
